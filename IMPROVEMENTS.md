## 🔴 Critical Bugs & Security Issues

### Security Improvements Completed ✓
- [x] **Rate Limiting** - Implemented with `express-rate-limit`
  - General limiter: 1000 requests per 15 minutes
  - Auth endpoints: 10 requests per 15 minutes
  - AI endpoints: 100 requests per 15 minutes

- [x] **CSRF Protection** - Implemented via SameSite cookies
  - Development: `sameSite="lax"` prevents CSRF from external sites
  - Production: `sameSite="none"` with `secure=true` + strict CORS
  - HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS token theft

- [x] **Input Sanitization** - Backend sanitization middleware implemented
  - Sanitizes all incoming request bodies
  - Removes dangerous HTML/script patterns
  - Applied before all endpoint processing

- [x] **Verification Tokens Hashed** - Tokens now hashed in database (SHA-256)
  - Email verification tokens hashed before storage
  - Password reset tokens hashed before storage
  - Comparison done via hashing incoming tokens

- [x] **Account Lockout** - Implemented after failed login attempts
  - Locks account after 5 failed login attempts
  - 15-minute lockout duration
  - Shows remaining attempts before lockout
  - Auto-resets on successful login

**Note:** Password reset tokens were already being invalidated after use (clearing `verificationToken` and `tokenExpiresAt`).

### Critical Functionality Bugs
- [ ] **ESLint Suppressions Throughout Codebase** - 11 `@ts-ignore` / `eslint-disable` comments
  - Location: 5 files including `backend/src/server.ts`, `frontend/src/components/nesa/sql-editor.tsx`
  - Impact: Type safety compromised, potential runtime errors
  - Fix: Address underlying type issues instead of suppressing

- [ ] **24 Console.log Statements in Production Code**
  - Locations: 14 files across frontend
  - Impact: Console pollution, performance overhead, exposed debugging info
  - Fix: Remove or replace with proper logging library

- [ ] **TypeScript "any" Types** - 2 occurrences in stores
  - Location: `frontend/src/store/exam.ts`, `frontend/src/store/pomodoro.ts`
  - Impact: Type safety lost
  - Fix: Define proper types

- [ ] **No Resend Verification Email Endpoint** - Users stuck if email expires
  - Location: `frontend/src/app/workspace/page.tsx:45` - Comment mentions missing endpoint
  - Impact: Users can't verify email if initial link expires
  - Fix: Create `/api/auth/resend-verification` endpoint

- [ ] **Dashboard Stats Are Hardcoded** - "+12% this week" is static
  - Location: `frontend/src/app/page.tsx:91`
  - Impact: Misleading statistics
  - Fix: Calculate actual week-over-week changes

- [ ] **Quiz Accuracy Calculation May Be Wrong** - Checking `isCorrect` on output object
  - Location: `frontend/src/app/page.tsx:281-293`
  - Impact: Inaccurate stats
  - Fix: Review calculation logic, ensure it matches actual data structure

- [ ] **Streak Calculation Too Simplistic** - Just counts unique days, capped at 7
  - Location: `frontend/src/app/page.tsx:296-299`
  - Impact: Not a real streak (doesn't check consecutive days)
  - Fix: Implement proper consecutive day calculation

- [ ] **No Error Handling for Failed Auth Bootstrap** - Silent failure
  - Location: `frontend/src/store/auth.ts:32` - Empty catch block
  - Impact: Users don't know why auth failed
  - Fix: Log errors, show user-friendly message

- [ ] **LocalStorage Quota Can Be Exceeded** - Large flashcard/exam sessions
  - Location: All modules using localStorage
  - Impact: Data loss, broken functionality
  - Fix: Implement quota checking, compression, or IndexedDB migration

### Medium Priority Bugs
- [ ] **Exam Timer Continues When Tab Inactive** - `setInterval` keeps running
  - Location: All timer implementations
  - Impact: Inaccurate time tracking
  - Fix: Use `document.visibilityState` API to pause timers

- [ ] **PDF Worker Path Hardcoded** - May break in different environments
  - Location: PDF upload components
  - Impact: PDF parsing fails if path incorrect
  - Fix: Use environment variable or dynamic path resolution

- [ ] **Date Formatting Hardcoded to en-US** - Not i18n friendly
  - Location: Multiple components using `toLocaleDateString`
  - Impact: Wrong date format for non-US users
  - Fix: Use user's locale or app-wide setting

- [ ] **Mobile Dialogs Don't Fit on Small Screens** - Overflow issues
  - Location: Various modal/dialog components
  - Impact: Poor mobile UX
  - Fix: Make dialogs responsive, add scroll

- [ ] **Markdown Rendering Edge Cases** - Code blocks/tables may not render correctly
  - Location: Any component rendering markdown
  - Impact: Content displays incorrectly
  - Fix: Test with complex markdown, fix CSS

- [ ] **Image Occlusion Editor Lags with Large Images** - No optimization
  - Location: `frontend/src/components/modules/flashcard-maker.tsx`
  - Impact: Poor UX, browser freezes
  - Fix: Resize images before editing, use canvas optimization

- [ ] **Subject Formatting Inconsistency** - "software-engineering" vs "Software Engineering"
  - Location: Multiple places throughout app
  - Impact: Visual inconsistency
  - Fix: Centralize formatting in `formatSubject` utility

- [ ] **Quiz Session State Lost on Navigation** - No persistence
  - Location: Quiz mode component
  - Impact: Users lose progress if they navigate away
  - Fix: Save state to localStorage or prompt before navigation
